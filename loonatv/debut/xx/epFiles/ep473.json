'Orrery Nim' did a great job at explaining this in the comments so I'll quote them here.<br>\"the pun explained, for non-korean-speakers:It's based on the start of her name (oli), which sounds similar enough to \"going up\" or \"raising up\" (remember don't-RAISE-IT-or-lower-it-olivia-colombia-hye), so while they were talking about going up stairs all the time, she strikes, telling her...\rThat's why she's oli-via hye\"<br>0:31 -- Hyejoo starts climbing the stairs for her shoot. Go Won: \"Hwaiting~\" and she wishes her well.<br>0:45 -- Hyejoo says that she likes to shoot on the stairs like this. Go Won: \"Go up a step!\" (bruh Go Won lowkey savage!)<br>0:54 -- She was referring to them standing on the staircase while shooting this part of the LOOΠΔ TV.",
