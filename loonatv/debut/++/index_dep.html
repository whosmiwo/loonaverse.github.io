<br>0:01 -- HeeJin is alone on the set as she has to film an individual scene. (The one wear she jumps off the bridge.) She doesn't know she has to do it.
<br>0:26 -- Teleported to the rooftop, we get to see how this part was filmed. A stunt double was hung with a harness and pulled in the air. Heekki appreciates her efforts.
<br>0:36 -- HeeJin realizes the safety measures but still considers it dangerous. She also knows that this will be the highlight so she has to do her best to connect her running with the jump.
